    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
    I am <strong>Filip Zdravković</strong>, a 24-year-old software developer from Serbia, currently based in Jakarta.
    I have spent the last four years studying Computer Science at <strong>RAF College in Belgrade</strong>,
    where I developed a strong analytical mindset and a solid foundation in both theoretical and applied computing.
    </p>

    <p>
    My technical background includes <strong>C and Java programming</strong>,
    <strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>, <strong>algorithm design</strong>,
    <strong>database systems</strong>, <strong>operating systems</strong>, and
    <strong>human–computer interaction</strong>, along with hands-on experience in
    <strong>neural networks</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and
    <strong>genetic algorithms</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In parallel with my academic work, I actively build real-world projects, including
    <strong>full-stack web applications</strong>, writing <strong>custom Tampermonkey scripts</strong>,
    and designing <strong>high-fidelity Figma prototypes</strong>.
    I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and creating user-centric interfaces
    with strong attention to performance and usability.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am highly motivated to <strong>continue learning, complete my degree, and grow into a versatile and impactful engineer</strong>.
    I actively seek new challenges, technologies, and complex problems that push me beyond my current skill set.
    I am a fast learner, disciplined, and persistent, with a strong ability to adapt to new tools and environments.
    </p>

    <p>
    I thrive in collaborative team environments and communicate clearly and confidently,
    while also being comfortable working independently when required.
    Beyond software development, I value personal growth, discipline, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle,
    believing that long-term excellence in engineering is built on both technical mastery and personal integrity.
